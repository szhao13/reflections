What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create an empty repository. This creates all the necessary files and the space to create your new project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the repository. It allows you to group multiple changes together into a logical commit.
