When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working on another computer or you are collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Someone else could be working on the repository at the same time as you and their changes could conflict with yours.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork makes a copy of a repository through GitHub only. Clone makes a copy of a repository either from GitHub to your local machine or within the local machine itself. Branches don't create a new repository but rather create a new commit. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can work offline and you don't have to resolve conflicts between your local repository and the github repository immediately while you still have internet access.
