When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working on another computer or you are collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Someone else could be working on the repository at the same time as you and their changes could conflict with yours.
