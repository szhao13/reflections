When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working on another computer or you are collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Someone else could be working on the repository at the same time as you and their changes could conflict with yours.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork makes a copy of a repository through GitHub only. Clone makes a copy of a repository either from GitHub to your local machine or within the local machine itself. Branches don't create a new repository but rather create a new commit. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can work offline and you don't have to resolve conflicts between your local repository and the github repository immediately while you still have internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder
If you wanted to collaborate without using Git or GitHub, you could use email or Dropbox to share files. It would be easier to share the change because you wouldn't need to add, commit, push and then merge - but then you would have to meet up to discuss conflicts each time.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Having a separate branch allows you to work on experimental changes and features that could break your main product and aren't production ready yet.
